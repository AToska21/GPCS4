Basically, the Issues page only accept program bug report.
For feature request, suggestions and other questions, go to Discussions page: https://github.com/Inori/GPCS4/discussions

GPCS4 is not ready for end-users, it only focus on some specific targets currently, so most of other games won't run.
If you are not a developer, then it's better to wait and do not spam here.
If you are a developer and willing to contribute, feel free to raise an issue or PR to contact me.
